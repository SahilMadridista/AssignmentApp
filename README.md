# AssignmentApp

This app was my Internship Assignment.

They told me to make an android app with these 3 features :

- login/register (User is logged if app is opened second time)
- push notifications (some promotional content)
- integrate twitter API (can also integrate login with twitter feature)

All these functions are implemented in this app with a decent looking user interface.

In this app Firebase is used for storing the information of user ( email and password )  and for push notifications.
- Firebase sends you a notification of this app every morning at 7:30
